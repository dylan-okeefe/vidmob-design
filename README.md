## Things I would have liked to have done with more time
Used Redux.  
Validated input on every view and shown alerts if input was empty.  
Reduced redundency in styling and seperated into different files.  
Validate domains when entering on Company Signup mode.  
Had email input persist when browser back to email input.  
Better formatting on some components and more uniform naming of variables, functions and components.
